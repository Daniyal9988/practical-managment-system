# Student Practical Management System

This project, developed as part of my Web Programming course, represents my inaugural full-scale project endeavor. The system, constructed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, stands as a testament to my foundational skills in web development. The accompanying file provides comprehensive documentation, detailing all system features and offering a user-friendly guide for seamless navigation.
